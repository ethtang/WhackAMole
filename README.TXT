# README for WhackAMole #

FUTURE: Implement console prompts that allow the user to set the number of whack attempts and the grid dimensions.  

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Create a game that uses a 2D array and interface the user interacts with. The WhackAMole class creates the game as an object and its methods. The main method declares and controls the WhackAMole game. The user has 50 whacks to find all the hidden moles and win. 

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Method 1: Download files and open with a Java IDE, preferably BlueJ. Method 2: Create a new Java project in an online Java IDE, preferably Replit. Copy and paste each .java file into the IDE.

USER INSTRUCTIONS: Follow the prompts in the console while examining the code. Enter the row (y coordinate) then column (x coordinate) to whack a point on the grid. Good luck!
